# LIDAR Horror Game

A first-person horror game where players navigate through a forest of steel poles using a LIDAR scanner to detect their surroundings and avoid a pursuing monster. Your goal is to find your way to your ship at the edge of the steel forest.

## üéÆ Game Features

### First-Person Perspective
- Mouse-controlled camera movement with smooth rotation
- Immersive gameplay from the player's viewpoint
- Movement relative to camera direction
- Pointer lock for better control

### LIDAR Scanning System
- Press SPACE to initiate a 360-degree scan
- 5-second cooldown between scans
- Color-coded scanning results:
  - Green lines: Steel poles
  - Red lines: Monster
  - Cyan lines: Walls
  - Yellow lines: Escape ship
- Visual feedback for scan progress and cooldown
- Scanning takes 2 seconds to complete

### Dynamic Monster AI
- Monster spawns after 60 seconds of player movement
- Pursues player at a slower speed
- Visible through LIDAR scanner with distinct red signature
- Can navigate around walls and obstacles
- Intelligent pathfinding to reach the player

### Complex Environment
- Dense forest of thick steel poles (100+ poles)
- Maze-like walls and structures (20+ walls)
- Larger play area for exploration (2x canvas size)
- Collision detection with walls and obstacles
- Procedurally generated layout

### Escape Objective
- Find your ship at the edge of the steel forest
- Ship visible through LIDAR scanner with yellow signature
- Victory screen upon reaching the ship
- Ship spawns at a random edge location
